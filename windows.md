Windows
=======
Not my favorite OS, but I need it for Unreal Engine work and building apps for Windows users. 
I'll need to take a lot of notes since I've seldom used the OS since the mid-200Xs. 

Setup fresh machine for development
-----------------------------------
Something I may need to automate. 

1. [ ] Turn off Microsoft One Drive.
2. [ ] Download browsers Chrome and Firefox. 
    1. [ ] Install uBlock Origin in each. 
    2. [ ] Set as default.
3. [ ] Set up password manager and browser extensions.
4. [ ] Download IDEs **CLion** and **Visual Studio Code**.
    1. [ ] Install vim keybindings
    2. [ ] Install Rust plugin in CLion
5. [ ] Install **Visual Studio** with Game Development support
    1. [ ] Choose **Workloads > Game Development with C++**" (required for Unreal Engine)
    2. [ ] Choose Workloads > "Desktop development with C++" (not sure  if this is required)
    3. [ ] Choose **Individual Components > .NET Framework SDK** (4.6 or higher)
    4. [ ] Choose **Individual Components > .NET Framework targeting pack** (4.6 or higher)
    5. [ ] Install vim keybindings
7. [ ] Install Epic Games Launcher, Unreal Engine (correct versions), Quixel Bridge
    1. [ ] Run Unreal Engine, which will ask to install .NET components
    2. [ ] Start an Unreal Engine project. If it fails due to Visual Studio, try running the Visual Studio installer again. 
8. [ ] Download Github Desktop
