Windows
=======
Not my favorite OS, but I need it for Unreal Engine work and building apps for Windows users. 
I'll need to take a lot of notes since I've seldom used the OS since the mid-200Xs. 

Setup fresh machine for development
-----------------------------------
Something I may need to automate. 

1. Turn off One Drive.
2. Download browsers Chrome and Firefox. Install uBlock Origin in each. Set as default.
3. Set up password manager and browser extensions.
4. Download IDEs CLion, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio.
